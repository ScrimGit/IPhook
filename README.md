# disc-IP-webhook
Discord webhook to send raspberry pi IP on boot
to use:
replace webhook with you're webhook link from discord
then git clone this repo
and use: sudo cp ip-webhook/rc.local /etc/rc.local
to enable running it on boot.

**i will add better instructions / more customization to the readme file in the next version.
***script is not running at boot :( looking in to it however the script works great and will be cleaned up in a near update
